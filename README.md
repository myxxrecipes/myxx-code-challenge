# Myxx Coding Challenge

Your goal is to deliver a single-page web application that utilizes the SpaceX API to showcase details regarding following 4 SpaceX rockets: 

* Falcon 1
* Falcon 9
* Falcon Heavy
* Starship

The application will be a single web page displaying all 4 rockets. When a user clicks on a rocket, a modal will appear with the details about that respective rocket. To close the modal, a user will press the `x` in the top left hand corner. 

If wishing to go the extra mile and want to make the application mobile responsive, the rockets should be displayed 1 at a time as a carousel. The user can tap the left and right carrot icons in the carousel to toggle back and forth between rockets. 

This exercise should take a couple of hours. If you have time or want to spend additional time on the exercise, we would love to see the following:

* CSS Animations
* Testing
* Documentation
* Mobile responsiveness
* Published (Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)

 Things to Consider:
* Instrumentation
* User tracking
* Performance
* Security

The documentation for the SpaceX API you will be using is located [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/README.md).

### Tech Stack

This project uses the `create-react-app` tool to scaffold a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). You do not necessarily have to use this, but we would prefer that you do.

# Getting Started 


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

If you wish to write unit tests, this will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
