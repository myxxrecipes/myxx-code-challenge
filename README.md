# Myxx Coding Challenge

## The Goal

Your goal is to deliver a single-page web application based on the designer mockups below that utilizes the SpaceX API to showcase details regarding the following 4 SpaceX rockets: 

* *Falcon 1*
* *Falcon 9*
* *Falcon Heavy*
* *Starship*

**Notes**: When the user clicks on a rocket, a modal will appear with the details about that respective rocket. To close the modal, the user will press the `x` in the top left hand corner. 

## Resources

You will find all asset files in the `public` folder in the repository

The documentation for the SpaceX API you will be using is located [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/README.md)

## Completing the Challenge

This exercise should take a couple of hours.

To complete this challenge, please either submit a PR to this repository with your code, or provide a link to a repository where we can view the code. If you have published the code to Heroku or another hosting service, please provide that link as well. 

## Extra Credit
If you have time or want to spend additional time on the exercise, we would love to see the following:

* CSS Animations
* Testing
* Documentation
* Published (*Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.*)
* Mobile responsiveness
  *  *The rockets should be displayed one at a time as a carousel. The user can tap the left and right carrot icons in the carousel to toggle back and forth between rockets*


##  Things to Consider
* *How would you instrument the application to track page performance? Errors?*
* *Is there anything to worry about in regards to security?*
* *What are the pitfalls of using a 3rd party API?*

## Getting Started

This project uses the `create-react-app` tool to scaffold a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).  If you wish to use another front-end framework, please feel free.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

If you wish to write unit tests, this will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
